This is my first note for the Git lab exercise.
Learning about version control with Git is essential for collaborative development.
I'm excited to practice cloning, committing, pushing, and pulling changes.

## Summary
Git is a powerful distributed version control system that helps teams collaborate effectively on code projects.
This exercise covered the basics of Git workflow including cloning repositories, making commits, and synchronizing changes between local and remote repositories.

## Insights
Understanding branching and merging strategies is crucial for managing complex development workflows.

## Best Practices
Always write clear commit messages and commit frequently to track progress effectively.

## Rebase Example
This section was added on the feature/rebase-demo branch to demonstrate rebasing.
